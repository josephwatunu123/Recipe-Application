# Recipe Items Purchase Application

This is a flutter application that assumes an application for purchasing food items provided
by an API.
On launch, the application makes a request to the API and stores a specific number of items provided
to a hive and displays it to the user.
The user can then add items to cart and later on view the items stored in the cart.
The application completes with a dummy check out that makes a post request to a dummy api
:https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1
After the check out, the app displays the response to the user i.e success or error.
